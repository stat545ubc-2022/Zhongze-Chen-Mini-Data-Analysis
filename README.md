# STAT 545A Mini Data Analysis - Zhongze Chen

This is the repository for STAT545A mini data analysis. The project has two milestones.

### Introduction

For the first milestone, I explored the datasets available to choose some datasets to research on. Then I did some preliminary analysis on the chosen datasets to come up with some research questions. Next I used some `dplyr` operations and `ggplot` to process and plot the dataset, attempting to answer my research questions.

For the second milestone, I tidied the dataset and manupulated factors. I also fit a model to answer selected research question and save/load data and model.

### Getting Started
To view the generated data analysis report, open `mini-project-1.md` or `mini-project-2.md`. To modify the report or to reproduce the result, open `mini-project-1.Rmd` or `mini-project-2.Rmd` in a code editor of your choice, modify the code as you like and then knit to document to see the updated report.
